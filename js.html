        Imperative vs Declarative Programming

        Imperative
        - js: how the user interface should be updated
        
        Declarative
        - react: declare what you want to show (e.g., h1 with some text)
        
        "In other words, imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. 
        Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï"
        
        - thus, in react you as the developer tell React what you want to happen to the UI. react will figure out how to update dom.
